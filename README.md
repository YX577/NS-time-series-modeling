# NS time-series modeling
 
This toolbox contain (or aims at containing) several identification methods for non-stationary and non-linear systems. Most of the identification methods are based on discrete-time time-series models (AutoRegressive and similar). This toolbox gathers several identification methods that I have been working on for the last years, and include Time-dependent ARMA (TARMA) model types, Linear Parameter Varying ARMA (LPV-ARMA) model types, and Kalman Filter Frequency Trackers for identification multi-component non-stationary sinusoids.
I will slowly include more functions while this toolbox is under construction, and as my research is going on. 

I hope you find it useful!
